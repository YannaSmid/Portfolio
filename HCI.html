                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Airports are places of anticipation, of reunions, adventures, and new beginnings. But for many, they’re also filled 
                    with stress, uncertainty, and long hours of waiting. We asked: What if looking up your flight could feel less like 
                    decoding a spreadsheet, and more like exploring the world with your hands?
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project for Human Computer Interaction, reimagines flight information displays as an interactive, 3D globe interface, controlled entirely by hand 
                    gestures using Leap Motion. Instead of static screens filled with hard-to-read text, passengers can now physically engage 
                    with a dynamic world map. With the interactive FlightWave, you can see exactly where your flight will go and 
                    can interact with it in a way that’s playful, intuitive,
                     and calming.
                    Whether you’re a nervous traveler who needs reassurance, or a curious one excited by the journey ahead—this system makes the 
                    wait more meaningful. It transforms flight anxiety into wonder, and passive waiting into active exploration.

                    <li>
                        3D Flight Route Visualization: Users can see the actual path their plane will take across a rotating globe.
 
                    </li>
                    <li>Touchless Interaction: Powered by Leap Motion, passengers control the system using only hand gestures—no screens to touch, improving hygiene and accessibility.
                    </li>
                    <li>Custom Gesture System: Swipe to rotate the globe, Point to select a destination, Palm-up gesture to stop movement

                    <li>
                        Custom Controls: Tested several input methods (eye tracking, gestures, joystick), ultimately proposing a simple arcade-style 
                        controller optimized for microgravity.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>The project started with a simple question: how can we make airport monitors more informative, 
                fun, and stress-relieving? Many passengers experience flight anxiety—especially when unsure about where 
                their plane is flying. By visualizing the flight path, this tool can offer both reassurance and curiosity.
                The development taught us how to design around real-world user experience constraints, from motion control 
                limitations to age inclusivity and instruction clarity. Creating a fun, intuitive, and hygienic system also 
                showed how small design tweaks can make technology feel more human and less intimidating.
                Ultimately, this project showcased how emerging tech like Leap Motion can go beyond novelty and support 
                meaningful improvements in everyday environments like airports.
