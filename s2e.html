                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Life has its obstacles, but luckily, enough research is done every second of the day to help society 
                    overcome most of them. However, how much of it actually helps you in living your life? This projects 
                    invites you to join a peculiar race. Compete against someone else and see who reaches the finish line more easily...
                    
                </p>
                <p>"Living" was the central theme of the 2024 Science to Experience exhibition at V2 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.
                    Living as a woman involves greater risks in simple everyday tasks, such as driving [3].
                    In recent years, there has been increased attention on the lack of inclusivity in scientific research, revealing a significant gap across gender, race, and age [1].
                    This gap exists because research has primarily focused on the "standard" male body, in an effort to avoid the perceived complications of hormonal variations, and to reduce costs [4].
                    As a result, women often experience different side effects from medications[1], exhibit alternate symptoms for conditions like heart attacks[2], and are frequently misdiagnosed in cases of ADHD or autism [5].
                    These disparities make life more difficult and uncertain for many.

                    In Formula1mpossible, two players compete in a racing game to collect funding for their research.
                    One includes female data, the other does not.
                    Who reaches the finish line more easily? And who collects more money along the way?

                <h2>Features</h2>
                <ul>
                    
                    <li>Gameplay Mode: Two players compete against each other, each driving on their own track. 
                        However, the player on the track that represents research including women's data encounters
                         gaps in the road. When they fall into a gap, a message appears, sharing a fact about the 
                         consequences women face due to the lack of inclusivity in scientific research.
                        The other track, which excludes female data, has no gaps—making it easier for that player to reach 
                        the finish line. It also contains more coins, symbolizing increased financial support and sponsorship for 
                        their research.
                        Once both players reach the finish line, they are presented with the purpose of the game, raising 
                        awareness about gender bias in research. This reveals the project's goal: highlight the unequal 
                        challenges women face due to systemic gaps in data and design.
                    </li>
                    <li>Cinema Screen: The experience includes a big cinematic screen, for extra immersiveness with the racing game.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Racing chairs: Both players were invited to sit down on a chair. However, the chair for the inclusive data research was
                        less luxurious than the other side track...
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Gaming controllers: Two pro game controllers were used for a more comfortable gaming experience.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Inspiration: Invisible Women is a novel written by C. Perez. The project is completely inspired by the well written information and 
                        description about gender gaps in research [6]

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>This project was a wonderful experience in developing a creative project to spread awareness about a problem statement.
                During exhibiting Formula1mpossible, visitors were enjoying the game and impressed by the meaning behind it. 
                Overall, visitors complemented us on our work, and thanked us for choosing such an important and overlooked problem. 
                We are proud to have showed our racing game at such a wonderful place, and are glad that it was received very positively and effectively.
                We hope that this projects is the start of a race toward a fairer distribution in research.
