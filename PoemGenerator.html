                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Poetry is an art form that bridges emotion and creativity, but creating it can be a difficult task that 
                    requires mastery of language and sensitivity. Inspired by Taylor Swift’s poetic songwriting, our team developed 
                    Poetic Taybot, an artificial poetry generator that uses Taylor Swift's lyrics as its muse. 
                </p>
                <p>This project, completed for the course Computational Creativity, combined linguistic algorithms with
                     generative AI to create, present, and perform original poems in innovative ways.
                    The aim was to build a poetry generator using a Markov Chain algorithm trained on Taylor Swift's lyrics and to 
                    visualize and present three generated poems creatively using AI-generated voice, music, and art.

                <h2>Features</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Poetry Generation: The lyrics from Taylor Swift’s complete discography, including From the Vault tracks, were cleaned and formatted to serve as training data.
                        We implemented a Markov Chain algorithm to generate poetic verses with attention to Taylor’s stylistic elements, such as alliteration and similes.
                        </li>
                    <li>Creative Visualization: Selected poems were narrated through an AI voice synthesizer that mimicked Taylor Swift’s vocal tone and nuance.
                        A MIDI composition was created with the use of AI, that was inspired by beat poetry and Taylor Swift’s themes.
                        Lastly, AI art was generated to visualize the mood and tone of each poem.
                        </li>
                    <li>Final Presentation: A short video was integrated, showing the poems with visuals, music, and narration for an immersive experience.</li>
           
                </ul>

            <div class="container">
                <h2>Technical Details</h2>
                <p>For the creation of the visualization of the poems a few key technicalities were used: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Data Cleaning: Lyrical data was preprocessed by converting text to lowercases, removing special 
                        characters such as apostrophes, and standardizing contractions and grammatical forms.
                        
                    </li>Algorithm: A Markov Chain algorithm was used to pair each word with its subsequent word based on likelihood, generating sentences word by word.
                    We incorporated fallback mechanisms for unmatched words, and emphasized selecting alliterative options to align with Taylor’s style.
                    
                    <li>
                        Generative tools: Generetive AI tools were used for the narration, music, and art. ElevenLabs for voice synthesis.
                        Magenta for MIDI generation, processed in Ableton Live 11. AI art generator created accompanying visuals.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Concept Development: Drew inspiration from Taylor Swift’s lyrical style and subtle poetic undertone. 
                        Therefore, we quickly agreed to base our generator on her lyrics. </li>
                    <li>Data collection: By that time Taylor Swift had released nine albums, and three rerecorded albums. We collected 
                        all her lyrics for these albums from the Genius lyrics, and converted it to txt and csv files.  </li>
                    <li>Data preprocessing: The data consisted of raw texts, meaning that noise and unwanted characters were included. 
                        This was cleaned out to make the lyrics fully useable for poem generations.</li>
                    <li>Algorithm Implementation: We implemented a Markov Chain algorithm in Python to generate short poems 
                        of 5 lines with each no more than 60 characters. We personalised the algorithm to include alliterations.</li>
                    <li>Generative Experiments: We tested algorithm and finetuned the hyperparameters such as poem length and maximum words on each line. </li>
                    <li>Integration: Three poems were selected to visualize. We combined audio, visual, and textual elements into a cohesive multimedia presentation.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>The Poetic Taybot project demonstrated how computational techniques could amplify creativity and 
                reflect emotional responses. The collaboration of algorithmic precision and artistic interpretation opened up 
                the way for innovative poetic storytelling. In the end, Poetic Taybot generated poems that blended Taylor Swift’s 
                lyrical elegance with the unpredictability of AI creativity. The final video presentation captivated 
                the audience by delivering a multidimensional artistic experience that highlighted:
                 </p>
                 <li> The emotional resonance of Taylor’s lyrics. </li>
                 <li> The creative potential of generative AI in computational artist </li>
