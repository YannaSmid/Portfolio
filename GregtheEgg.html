                <p>
                    Meet Greg the Egg! A fluffy, pink creature with a playful personality and a need for 
                    constant interaction. Greg's personal playground is where he thrives, enjoying swings, 
                    merry-go-rounds, and seesaws. Greg’s charm lies in his ability to bring joy to anyone who 
                    plays with him, and in his sadness when left alone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the course Artificial Creatures, the challenge was to design and build a creature 
                    with a distinct personality using Arduino and minimal additional features. Our team aimed 
                    to create a lovable character that would connect emotionally with the audience.

                    <li>

                <li>Letting Arduino process and produce sounds is a more difficult task than anticipated. Arduino can only produce beeping sounds, with a low volume.</li>
                <li> In the end, we managed to come up with two distinct beeping rhythms that can be recognized as happy and sad.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Ideation: The first two weeks we brainstormed about ways to create a creature that emotionally connects with users. </li>
                    <li>Prototyping: After coming up with the idea of making a gregarious creature, we started sketching the design of the creature.  </li>
                    <li>Development: When fully agreeing on the design, we integrated Arduino Nano and sensors to bring Greg to life. Moreover, we started crafting the playground.</li>
                    <li>Testing: When the first developments were done, we started testing the functions of Greg. We observed audience interaction to refine Greg’s responses.</li>
                    <li>Finetuning: After testing, observed mistakes or malfunctions were corrected to prepare Greg for the final showdown. </li>
                    <li>Exhibition: Finally, it was time to let Greg shine and we showcased him during an exhibition where audience was able to play with him and enjoy his creatureness.</li>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Greg the Egg highlights how creativity and technology can come together to evoke empathy and joy. 
                The project reinforced the importance of designing with a user-centered and emotional perspective.
                Audience enjoyed playing with Greg, and were personally affected when leaving him behind. </p>
