                <p>
                    Who doesnâ€™t love playing a quick, fun mini-game? 
                    The Mini Game Tool empowers users to design their own parkour-style games, 
                    complete with challenges, enemies, and goals. After building their levels, users 
                    can immediately play and test their creations, enjoying the thrill of conquering custom-designed courses. 
                </p>
                <p>The course Creative Programming tasked us to develop a creative tool. With my interest in Video Games 
                    I decided to develop a creative tool that can be used to create a quick mini game. The tool provides an 
                    intuitive interface for users to design simple mini-games. In addition, it offers an engaging gameplay 
                    mode to test and enjoy the level created by the user. This encourages creativity and experimentation through game design.

                <ul>
                    <li>Level Editor Mode: Here users can place fixed-size game elements like ground tiles, enemies, 
                        a playable character and a goal. This mode includes an instructional bar for a straightforward design process.
                        </li>
                    <li>Gameplay Mode: This mode allows the player to play the lever they created. Players can walk, 
                        jump, and stick to ceilings within the designed levels. Physics-based mechanics, such as falling
                         and collision detection, create challenges. Winning conditions consider reaching the green goal. 
                         Losing conditions are met when colliding with enemies or falling off the map.

                        Interface design: color coding was used where green presents the goal, red the enemies, blue the player, and black the tiles. 
                        Moreover, grids were shown in the editor interface, for a clearer drawing experience.

                <ul>
                    <li>Conceptualization: I developed the idea of a mini-game creation tool inspired by my interest in Game AI and Development. 
                        I wanted to focus on simplicity to encourage creativity without overwhelming the users.</li>
                    <li>Implementation: I created a dual-mode system with a Level Editor and Gameplay Mode. Integrated 
                        physics-based mechanics and collision detection for realistic gameplay. </li>
                    <li>Testing: After multiple test runs, various errors were resolved and challenges were faced. Mouse and button interaction issues were optimized to enhance functionality. 
                        Moreover, user tests were applied to test the usability and the straightforwardness of the application.</li>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>This project challenged me to balance user friendly design with engaging gameplay mechanics in Processing.
                 While some features, such as the eraser tool, were too complex to implement in Processing, I am planning to continue this work and add this feature in the future. 
                 I am proud of the intuitive game experience that I created. This project allowed me to use my interest in game development 
                 and reinforce my ability to tackle complex programming challenges. I am happy with the result, and users really enjoyed it!</p>
