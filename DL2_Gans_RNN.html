                <p>
                    Let's see how well Generative AI models create cat faces, and sequence models solve mathematical equations.
                    This project explored different types of deep learning models for two distinct tasks. Generative models were
                    trained for generating new cat. Moreover, arithmetic expressions were tried to be solved using Recurrent Neural Networks.
                     We experimented with Autoencoders, GANs, and VAEs on the CAT dataset, and trained RNNs to interpret 
                     and solve addition and subtraction problems using the MNIST dataset, in both text and image formats.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Generative Models (CAE, VAE, GAN): We built and trained convolutional autoencoders (CAEs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), and GANs to 
                        generate and interpolate realistic cat faces. Afterwards, we conducted an extensive 
                        study on finetuning hyperparameters like batch size, latent dimensions, and filter sizes.
                        We Performed latent space interpolation for smooth image morphing between cat images.
                        In the end, the generated images results were looking very similar to each other, but were recognizable as cat faces.


                    </li>
                    <li>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): We developed three types of RNNs for solving arithmetic.
                        First we trained a Text-to-Text RNN. The model received a mathematical sequence as string for an input, 
                        and gives the solution as a string.
                        We did the same for an Image-to-Text RNN. Here, the model receives an equation as an image from MNIST 
                        digits. It then returns the solution as a string.
                        Lastly, we tried creating a text to image model, that receives strings as an input and outputs the solution in an image.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>This project helped me get more practical experience with generative models and sequence-based neural networks. 
                I learned that while VAEs offer more stable and interpretable results than GANs, they also come with computational 
                challenges. Building and comparing different RNN architectures deepened my understanding of how data format (text vs image) 
                impacts model performance. I especially enjoyed combining vision and language in creative ways, 
                like generating handwritten numbers from arithmetic expressions. The iterative process of tuning, analyzing, and 
                debugging these models was both frustrating and rewarding when you see it working. 
                It definitely showed me the fun applications of simple AI tasks.
