                <p>
                    Strategy Video Games can get fairly easy after a playing it for a while, because the enemy agents do not improve their strategies 
                    stay the same throughout the whole game. Eventhough the difficulty can be adjusted, research has shown that repetitive 
                    and predictable gameplay can reduce a player's engagement to a video game.
                    My thesis project, therefore, introduces a new game mode called Mirror Mode, where the enemy NPCs have imitated the player's strategies.
                    Think you're good at the game? Let's see how you handle your own moves.
                    
                </p>
                <p>The research built a simple strategy game from scratch in Unity Engine, based on Nintendo's Fire Emblem Heroes, developed by Intelligent Systems.
                    A Standard Mode is built, where enemy NPCs follow the traditional AI heuristics, that results in a greedy behavior where an enemy
                    always attacks if possible. In addition to this, the Mirror Mode is developped, where the enemy AI uses a model trained on player
                    gameplay data collected through real-life player tests. Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning algorithms are used for this.
                    The goal is to find a suitable model that can be applied to imitate player strategies, and to see if Mirror Mode has an effect on 
                    the player's game experience.

                    <li>
                        Gameplay: The game follows the basic rules from the original mobil stragey game Fire Emblem Heroes, by Nintendo and Intelligent Systems.
                        The game is more simplified than the original game, excluding any assists, skills, or special attacks. This game 
                        is purely based on the effectiveness of weapons, and unit stats. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Standard Mode: In Standard Mode, participants play against a traditional enemy AI, that follows heuristics to 
                        decide their actions. During the game, state-action pairs from the player units are recorded every turn, and saved in a 
                        demonstration file through Unity ML-Agent toolkit package. These demonstrations are important for training
                        the Mirror models.
                    </li>
                    <li>Mirror Mode: After Standard Mode, participants are asked to play Mirror Mode. Here, the enemy AI uses models
                        trained on player demonstrations through Imitation Learning. These models decide actions based on observed states.
                        The enemy behavior therefore copies players strategies.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>This research provides valuable insights to the experience of strategy games. For future work, it would be 
                great to further develop models to enhance the imitation quality, and see if this has a bigger impact 
                on game experience of players. There is still a long way to go to improve the adaptability of enemy NPCs,
                but this research sets the first strategic step toward that direction.
