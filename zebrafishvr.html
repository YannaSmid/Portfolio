                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    For my thesis, I explored the intersection of Virtual Reality (VR) and anatomical education by developing an 
                    immersive VR application. The project aimed to enhance the learning process of anatomy by visualizing a 3D ontology
                     system and applying gamification principles. This project showcases how VR can be an effective tool for scientific 
                     visualization, offering an engaging and interactive platform for life science research.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this project, we aimed to develop a VR environment that visualizes the anatomy of a zebrafish embryo, 
                    integrating a 3D ontology to organize and present anatomical hierarchy interactively. By incorporating gamification 
                    elements, the project aimed to create a more engaging and effective learning experience. Additionally, the usability 
                    and effectiveness of the application were evaluated through comprehensive user studies, which included direct observations
                     and detailed surveys.

            <div class="container">
                <h2>Process</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conceptualization: The project began with identifying the need for innovative methods in anatomical education, 
                        focusing on VR's potential to offer immersive and interactive experiences. Zebrafish embryos were selected as 
                        the model organism due to their relevance in life science research and developmental biology.</li>
                    <li>Sketching: To transform the concept into a visualization we made sketches to get a clear view of what we wanted 
                        to aim for. The anatomy of the zebrafish was organized into a 3D ontology to provide structured, accessible information. 
                        Three games were designed to reinforce key concepts, ensuring the application was both educational and engaging.</li>
                    <li>Data cleaning: Before the anatomical data could be used, it had to be preprocessed first. 
                        This was done by editing the text data manually, and restructuring the models by hand.</li>
                    <li>Algorithm Development: For the ontology visualization an algorithm was written to structure the anatomical data. </li>
                    <li>VR environment: The VR application was programmed using Unity. The ontology was implemented to allow users to explore
                         anatomical parts in detail, and the games were designed to study the anatomy in a more engaging way.</li>
                    <li>Testing and Fine-Tuning: User evaluations were conducted with participants from diverse backgrounds. Observations during 
                        gameplay and post-study questionnaires provided valuable insights into usability and learning outcomes. Iterative refinements 
                        were made based on feedback, ensuring the program was intuitive and effective.</li>
                    <li>Results presentation: The findings of this research were presented in a scientific paper and for the Thesis presentation.</li>

                <h2>Technical Details</h2>
               The main VR program was implemented in Unity, for a good and straightforward connection to HTC Vive controls. For the full process, several other technilogical systems were needed.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Python was needed to clean the anatomical text data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The HTC Vive VR set was needed for the application to run.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A stable PC with a strong graphics card was needed to run the Unity program.
                    </li>
                    <li>Anatomical data in .json format is necessary for the ontology visualization.
                    </li>
                    <li>3D objects for each anatomical part is needed.</li>

                <h2>Challenges</h2>
               <ul>
                <p> We encountered several difficulties throughout the process of this research.
                    For an optimal VR experience, space is limited in 3D environments. With big data sets such as anatomical data, 
                    visualizing all data can give a more chaotic VR environment. We proposed a method to only visualize one layer at a time 
                    to reduce this issue. However, with bigger data sets, layers will include more child objects.
                    Moreover, in VR the quality of the 3D objects is very important for the optimal learning experience. 
                    The objects we used were polished to make it as smooth as possible. </p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>With this project, we highlighted the potential of VR in educational settings. By integrating scientific accuracy 
                with interactive design, we were able to create a tool that not only teaches anatomy but also engages users in an 
                immersive learning experience The user feedback validated the effectiveness of this approach, and the lessons learned 
                from this project will inform my future endeavors in technology-driven education and research.</p>
