                <p>
                    How do players’ moral choices shift when immortality is introduced? Shades of Morality, 
                    a 2D platformer game, investigates this intriguing question. This research-based video game 
                    explores the effects of mortality and immortality on player behavior, offering unique insights
                     into decision-making in virtual environments.
                </p>
                <p>Shades of Morality was developed for the Video Games for Research course to investigate how immortality affects in-game moral decision-making.
                 By engaging players in morally charged dilemmas 
                    across mortal and immortal gameplay modes, this project sought to explore how virtual consequences shape player choices.

                <h2>Features</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Moral Dilemmas: Players encounter six carefully crafted moral choices that influence gameplay outcomes. 
                        For instance, deciding whether to save a trapped human or take a sword for personal gain presents players 
                        with challenging ethical decisions.
                        </li>
                    <li>Mortality Mechanics: Players were allowed to play two distinct levels. One is the Mortal Mode, where their playable character is able to die, but letting them respawn, creating higher stakes.
                        The other lever is the Immortal Mode, where players cannot die, allowing risk-free exploration of choices.
                        </li>
                    <li>Immersive Gameplay: Platformer mechanics include traps, enemies, and interactive environments that challenge players’ survival and decision-making skills.</li>
                    <li>Simple, Dark Aesthetic: The game features a mysterious and slightly eerie design, reinforcing its focus on moral ambiguity and the weight of decisions.</li>
                </ul>

        <section class="Shades of Morality: the Gameplay">
            <div class="container">
                <h2>Technical Details</h2>
                <p>The game is built as a 2D platformer using a Unity layout template by Nick Bota. 
                    The gameplay includes multiple elements to keep the game engaging.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Core Gameplay: The players control an adventurer navigating through mysterious rooms filled with 
                        moral dilemmas, traps, and enemies. The game features two levels: one where the character is mortal 
                        and another where they are immortal.  
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Moral Dilemmas: Each level includes three moral dilemmas where players must choose between moral 
                        and immoral actions, often trading ethical considerations for in-game rewards. For instance, donate 
                        money to starving villagers, providing no immediate benefit, or keep the money with no repercussions 
                        since currency has no importance in the game. Or choosing between freeing a trapped human or acquiring 
                        a sword that boosts your combat capabilities. Freeing the human offers no reward, while choosing the
                         sword leaves the human imprisoned.  
                    </li>
                    <li>Objective: The primary goal of the game is to survive and reach the end of the level while making 
                        choices that challenge the player’s moral reasoning.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conceptualizing: We found a topic of our research to investigate the influence of immortality on 
                        moral decisions. We set up a research question and research objectives.</li>
                    <li>Related Research: We delved into other studies that are related to this work, providing us with 
                        more insights and motivations to conduct this research.</li>
                    <li>Research set-up: With our team we developed a plan and a methodology to fulfill this research. 
                        We decided to create different versions of the games to make sure each room can be played as a moral character and an immortal character.</li>
                    <li>Game Development: Nikki Rademaker and I then built the game for the purpose of our research. 
                        We built the game in Unity. The background and environment design was done in Procreate. 
                        The room features and playable character came from the provided template. NPC’s were collected 
                        from the Unity Asset store.</li>
                    <li>Game testing: Before the game could be used for experiments, it had to be tested on bugs and 
                        usability. This was done by multiple user tests.</li>
                    <li>Experiments: Experiments were conducted to collect data for the research. In total 36
                         participants were found. We collected quantitative data on the choices they made and the 
                         time it took for them to decide. Moreover, they completed a questionnaire to reason their 
                         choices and mention their game experience.</li>
                    <li>Analysis: With the collected data we observed no significant differences in moral decisions 
                        between mortal and immortal modes. However, we identified hesitation and longer decision times 
                        for immoral actions in both modes. We evaluated feedback to identify areas for improvement, 
                        including narrative depth and clearer gameplay distinctions between modes.</li>

                </ul>

            <div class="container">
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Developing Shades of Morality was a unique opportunity to merge game design and academic research. While the results showed no significant impact of immortality on moral decisions, the project highlighted the potential of video games as research tools.
                Feedback revealed that players did not fully grasp the implications of mortality and immortality within the game. Future iterations could address this by:
                </p>
            <li>Introducing a stronger storyline to create emotional ties with NPCs.</li>
            <li>Amplifying the stakes of mortality by removing respawns for players and NPCs, making decisions more impactful.</li>
        
            <p>Despite the study's limitations, players enjoyed the game, and the project sparked engaging discussions about ethics in gaming.</p>
