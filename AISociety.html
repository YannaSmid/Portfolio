                <p>
                    This AI in Society research project explores how AI could radically reshape the future of healthcare. 
                    We imagine a treatment where diagnosing diseases becomes more accurate and animal testing in pharmaceutical industry has not been needed.
                    Instead of testing on animals, this treatment has been tested by AI!
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    As task, we were asked to present our idea in a creative and original way. So, we presented this topic as an interactive 
                    story in Episode. This project combines scientific insight, ethics, and creativity to imagine a more inclusive, 
                    humane, and sustainable AI-driven healthcare system. Only one question remains: Will you accept the new treatment?

                <h2>Features</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        AI in Medical Imaging: We explored how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) assist radiologists in diagnosing 
                        conditions like cancer with greater accuracy and speed.
                  </li>
                    <li>AI for Drug Discovery: In our new method, we proposed the use of neural networks to simulate drug effects in the human body,
                        removing the need for animal testing.

                    </li>
                    <li>Bias & Intersectionality: We examined how underrepresentation in medical datasets can lead to biased outcomes, 
                        especially for marginalized groups. This leads to large undiagnosed groups, and different side-effects 
                        of medicine among different groups.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sustainability & Ethics: We addressed the environmental cost of training AI and advocated for 
                        greener models and energy-efficient architectures.
                    </li>

                        The aim of the project imagines a near future where AI systems replace animal testing by using 
                        ethically sourced, intersectional human data to simulate drug effects.

                        Episode Interactive is used to program a story that shows the perspective of our character Mel.
                        She creates a model that tests medicine, and introduces her new development to other scientists.
                        The choice then remains, will they accept it or not?

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Working on this project reshaped how I view the role of AI in society. 
                Implementing AI is not just an interesting challenge offering new possibilies, it is a responsibility. 
                I learned that inclusivity and fairness must 
                be built into AI systems from the ground up, especially in impactful fields like healthcare. 
                Speculating about AI replacing animal testing forced me to think critically about data, ethics, 
                and who gets represented in these technologies. More than anything, this project reminded me that 
                the future of AI shouldn't just be powerful, it should be fair, compassionate, and for everyone.
