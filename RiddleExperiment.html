                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    The Riddle Experiment explores the dascinating similarity between human and artificial cognition in the context 
                    of Black Stories, a card-based mystery-solving game. Traditionally played in groups, this project investigates 
                    how effectively GPT-4, an advanced AI model, can emulate human deduction to solve these riddles.
                </p>
                <p>The Non-Human Cognition course challenged us to step beyond human perception and explore the cognitive abilities of animals or computers. For the final project, my teammates Nikki Rademaker, Linthe van Rooij, and I designed and conducted a study to evaluate the problem-solving capabilities of GPT-4 when tasked with solving Black Stories riddles.
                    Our aim was to determine whether GPT-4 could match human performance in solving these riddles and analyze how its reasoning process compared to that of humans.

                <h2>Features</h2>
                This research involved the following key features:
                <ul>
                    <li>AI vs. Human Riddle Solving: GPT-4 and human participants were tested on 
                        their ability to solve Black Stories riddles, showcasing a direct comparison between human and non-human cognition.
                        
                        </li>
                    <li>Conducting Research: We set up a study to investigate the performance of GPT-4 in solving Black stories riddles.
                         We did this through qualitative and quantitative research.
                        </li>
                    <li>GPT-4 OpenAI interface: GPT-4 was tested through the OpenAI API in Python.
                        </li>
                    <li>Poster Presentation: The research was presented by a poster presentation. We received the award for best poster presentation for this. We were provided with the opportunity to further present our research on CLIN exhibition and to continue with it for a publishment
                        </li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>This project provided valuable insights into the cognitive capabilities of AI and its limitations 
                in interactive contexts. We successfully designed an experiment to test human vs. AI cognition, 
                and were praised for the depth and originality of our research. We did come across some challenges. 
                Adapting riddles to prevent recognition by GPT-4 while maintaining their integrity required creativity 
                and precision, in order to make the research valid. Furthermore, there were many metrics to consider when
                 looking at the performance of solving riddles. We balanced quantitative data with qualitative insights posed 
                 analytical challenges but enriched the study's outcomes.
