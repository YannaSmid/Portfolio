                <h2>Hi, I'm Yanna Elizabeth Smid</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a <span class="purple-text">Creative Technologist</span> and <span class="purple-text">Computer Scientist</span> 
                    passionate about combining technology and creativity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I began my academic journey at University, where I took a bachelor's degree in 
                    <span class="purple-text">Computer Science and Biology</span>, graduating cum laude in 2023. 
                    During this program I not only discovered my love for artificial intelligence and 
                    game development but also was introduced to data science, and programming languages like Python, 
                    C#, and C++. During my exchange at Ohio State University, I discovered how to merge computer science 
                    with artistic expression, which inspired me to pursue more creative applications of technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is what led me to the master’s program in <span class="purple-text">Media Technology</span> (now Creative Intelligence and Technology) 
                    at Leiden University, where I was able to combine my creative thinking with my interest in Computer Science. 
                    This program has challenged me to think outside the box and allowed me to explore areas such as game development, 
                    creative coding, and interactive systems using tools like Processing and PureData. It also gave me the flexibility 
                    to deepen my expertise in Data Science and AI, through courses like Deep Learning, Evolutionary Algorithms, 
                    and AI in Society.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, <span class="purple-text">Game development</span> has been a recurring theme throughout my studies. 
                    From creating games for the Video Games for Research course to side projects with my talented teammate, 
                    Nikki Rademaker. I’ve been able to integrate my technical skills and creative thinking to design unique 
                    gaming experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I’m working on my thesis, which explores the application of AI in strategy games. 
                    Alongside this, I’m taking a course in <span class="purple-text">Game AI</span> that perfectly aligns with my research. 
                    I am eager to see how these experiences shape my future in developing innovative projects at 
                    the intersection of technology and creativity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m thrilled to share some of my favorite projects from over the years in this portfolio. 
                    If you have any questions, feel free to contact me. Let’s explore the possibilities together!
