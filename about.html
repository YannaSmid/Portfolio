                <h2>Hi, I'm Yanna Elizabeth Smid</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a <span class="purple-text">Creative Technologist</span> and <span class="purple-text">Computer Scientist</span> 
                    passionate about combining AI and creativity.
                </p>

                <h3>Educational Journal</h3>
                <p>
                    In 2019, I started my bachelor's degree in 
                    <span class="purple-text">Bioinformatics</span> at Leiden University, which I finished cum laude in 2023. 
                    During this program I quickly began to realize that I enjoyed writing code, which I had never done before.
                    Programming is just using mathematics to solve puzzles!
                    Later on I found my interest in many areas within Computer Science, especially AI, Date Science, and Game Development.

                    During my exchange at Ohio State University in 2023, I discovered how to merge Computer Science 
                    with my creative mindset, which inspired me to pursue more creative applications of technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is what led me to the master’s program in <span class="purple-text">Media Technology</span> (now Creative Intelligence and Technology) 
                    at Leiden University, where I was able to combine my creative thinking with my interest in Computer Science. 
                    This program has challenged me to think outside the box and allowed me to explore areas such as game development, 
                    creative coding, and interactive systems using tools like Processing and PureData. It also gave me the flexibility 
                    to deepen my expertise in Data Science and AI, through courses like Deep Learning, Modern Game AI, Evolutionary Algorithms, 
                    and AI in Society.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I’m finishing up my thesis, which exploreed the application of Reinforcement Learning
                    and Imitation Learning techniques in strategy games. Here I was able to train AI models for one of 
                    my favorite Nintendo video games, Fire Emblem. 
                    
                </p>

                <h3>Personal Hobbies</h3>
                <p>
                    In my free time, besides studying, I like to be very active. I have a lot of hobbies, even though I 
                    am not very well in most of them.
                    I love to draw portraits, cartoons, or animals. Especially while sitting outside, enjoying the sun.
                    Besides drawing, I like to go out rollerskating with my best friend and talented teammate Nikki Rademaker,
                    who I enjoyed working with in most of my projects.
                    If the weather doesn't allow outside activities, I am the happiest on my couch with my cat playing
                    video games. Or when I am feeling inspired, I love writing lyrics to songs, or stories. I am still trying to 
                    learn how to play the guitar, my favorite instrument.
                </p>

                <h3>Future Goal</h3>
                <p>
                    With my knowledge and interests I would really like to create interesting and creative AI applications 
                    that can help society. Whether it is analyzing data for greater inclusivity in research, 
                    or improving video game quality with new found AI techniques.  
                    I’m very excited to share some of my favorite projects from over the years in this portfolio. 
                    Feel free to reach out if you have any questions, ideas, or just want to say hi.
