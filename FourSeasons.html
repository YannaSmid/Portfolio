                <p>
                    The Four Seasons Video Game is created for the course Introduction to Video Game Making. 
                    My Level, Frostfire Quest, is my contribution to a collaborative FPS microgame inspired by the theme of the four
                    seasons. While others explored spring or summer, I dove deep into the quiet intensity of winter. I wanted to
                     design a level that didn’t just look cold, but felt immersive and engaging to figure out, like a puzzle game. 

         
                </p>
                <p>
                    Frostfire Quest is a first-person puzzle shooter inspired by the classic Zelda-style 
                    dungeon design. Built within Unity’s FPS Microgame framework, the level immerses the player in a snowy, 
                    abandoned winter house where the key to progress lies in solving environmental challenges, defeating enemies, 
                    and finding the legendary fire blaster, to melt the ice cubes that block your way to the next level.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Seasonal Worldbuilding: The Video Game transitions from late autumn to a full-on winter theme, creating a coherent 
                        and immersive environment.
                    </li>
                    <li>Puzzle-based Progression: Players must find and use the fire blaster to melt ice obstacles and unlock new paths.
                    </li>
                    <li>Zelda-Inspired Mini Boss Battle: Classic structure with a challenging enemy encounter to earn the key item.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Environmental Mechanics: There are slippery ice floors, freezing cubes, and moving platforms. This makes the 
                        game more challenging.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Layered Level Design: There is a gradual introduction of mechanics and increasing difficulty, to keep the player engaged and learning.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>This project was an opportunity to mix mechanical design, level pacing, and thematic storytelling. 
                This was the first Video Game I ever created, and I had found inspiration from my
                favorite Zelda games. I aimed to bring that structure into a modern FPS format. I learned how to design rewarding 
                challenges, introduce mechanics through gameplay, and build levels that guide players intuitively. It also taught me how to balance difficulty—especially when combining puzzles, combat, and platforming.

            The result is a nostalgic, snowy puzzle adventure that encourages exploration, discovery, and a little bit of firepower.
            For future work I would like to adjust the difficulty of the game, as it can be frustrating to play due to the difficulty.
